# Contributor Guidelines

## Before you start

- Post an issue on the 'https://github.com/Mind-Surfer/stringToUuid/issues/new/choose' describing the bug or feature you would like to add
- If an issue already exists, leave a comment to let others know that you intend to work on it
- If you are unsure about anything, ask!

## Submitting a pull request

- Reference the issue # that the pull request is related to
- Make sure you have merged in the latest changes from the ``main`` branch
- Be prepared to have your code reviewed.
  For non-trivial additions, it's normal for this process to take a few iterations
